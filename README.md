## Setup Tutorial for Emulating Games Neatly

Recommended setup for those looking to emulate games by configuring standalone emulators rather than using multi-system emulators. In this case, you will need to download each emulator individually.

That's why I decided to create this organized and suitable solution for those who prefer this approach. Even so, you'll still need to do some setup work.
